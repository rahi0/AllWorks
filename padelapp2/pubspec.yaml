description: A new Flutter project.

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/img/rahi.jpg
   - assets/img/aaa.jpg
   - assets/img/b.jpg
   - assets/img/aa.jpg
   - assets/img/bcg1.jpg
   - assets/img/tir.png
   - assets/img/logo.png
   - assets/img/adidas.png
   - assets/img/asics.png
   - assets/img/head.png
   - assets/img/d.jpg
   - assets/img/c.jpg
   - assets/img/bb.jpg
   - assets/img/t.jpg
   - assets/img/t2.jpg
   - assets/img/t3.jpg
   - assets/img/t4.jpg
   - assets/img/g.png
   - assets/img/g2.png
   - assets/img/g3.png
   - assets/img/g4.png
   - assets/img/tn.png
   - assets/img/bg.jpg
   - assets/img/x.jpg
   - assets/img/xx.jpg
   - assets/img/bg2.jpg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: BebasNeue
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/BebasNeue-Bold.ttf
          weight: 900
        - asset: fonts/BebasNeue-Book.ttf
        - asset: fonts/BebasNeue-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: fonts/BebasNeue-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: fonts/BebasNeue-Thin.ttf
          weight: 200
          style: italic
    - family: Lato
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Lato-Black.ttf
          weight: 900
        - asset: fonts/Lato-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/Lato-Hairline.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Lato-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: fonts/Lato-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
